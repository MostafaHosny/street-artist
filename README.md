  The home screen is the main page which you can search to find your favorite artist 
1. When I am in the admin page, I want to be able to create artists or edit them, so that I
      can fill up our artist database

2. When I am in the search page, I want to have a textfield input and a search button,
      so that I can search for artists
    
3. When I input text and click search, I want to see a list of artists, so that I can click
      them and see details of the ones I like the most

4. When I start writing in the search textfield, I want to see a suggestion of words list, so
      that I can have better ideas of what to type.

5. When there are more than 10 artists, I want to see pagination so that I donâ€™t load all
      of them if we have 10,000 artists.

6. When I click search, I want to see the artists without reloading the website, so that I
      can have a better UX experience.
